## Introduction
_**Transform your Stream Deck into the ultimate sim racing button box!**_

With Auto Fuel and Auto Pressure buttons, just turn a few laps to lock in perfect fuel and pressures for optimized setups and pitstops, regardless of setup type, track conditions, or driving style! It adapts to YOU, the driver, and the conditions you're driving in real time. Effortlessly manage fueling and pressure adjustments automatically‚Äîwhether in the garage or pitstop MFD‚Äîso you can _just push_ on track!
